    <p>
        To implement the API for deleting books, we need to set up an API
        endpoint using a <Code
            code="+server.ts"
            inline
        /> file at the route of the endpoint. In this project we will have this file
        at <Code
            code="src/routes/api/books/[id]/+server.ts"
            inline
        />. The route takes the book's ID as a parameter.

    <div class="inline">
        <ApiDelete.Content />
    </div>
