<Section>
    <h2
        slot="title"
        id="users"
    >
        User
    </h2>
    <p>
        This section will cover the implementation of both server side logic and
        client side interactivity with Users.<br />This project functions more
        as an admin panel, so users are manually created and there is no sign up
        process.
    </p>
    <Fetch />
    <Actions />
    <Page />
    <Api />
    <p>
        <br />
        The full page should now function like the following example, except for
        that state will persist page reloads:<br />
        <small
            ><i
                >The unfinished pages has been omitted, for clarity of what is
                relevant to this page</i
            ></small
        >
    </p>
    <div class="inline">
        <div class="example">
            <BooksSvelte client:load />
        </div>
    </div>
</Section>
