        id="loans"
    >
        Loans
    </h2>
    <p>
        This section will cover the implementation of both server side logic and
        client side interactivity with Loans. Unlike the other pages, loans are
        created at the root, so file locations will be <Code
            code="src/routes/+page.svelte"
            inline
        /> and <Code
            code="src/routes/+page.server.ts"
            inline
        />.
    </p>
    <Fetch />
    <Actions />
    <Page />
    <Api />
    <p>
        <br />
        The full page should now function like the following example, except for
        that state will persist page reloads:<br />
        <small
            ><i
                >The unfinished pages has been omitted, for clarity of what is
                relevant to this page</i
            ></small
        >
    </p>
</Section>
